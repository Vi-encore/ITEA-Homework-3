              In more traditional work settings, the definition of a good
              employee was someone who came to the office on time at 9 a.m., sat
              at their desk and worked hard, taking direction from their
              managers and following the rules. This model employee would be
              there rain or shine, always appearing busy until it was time to go
              home at 6 p.m. But with the development of smartphones and
              internet technologies, many companies are starting to form virtual
              teams with team members living in different time zones, and
              employees are now finding themselves answering emails, attending
              meetings and working on reports from home outside their usual
              working hours. People now need to work smarter and not just
              harder.

              Successful business requires collaboration and teamwork. For team
              relationships to work well, we need high levels of trust. But how
              we build trust can differ from person to person, culture to
              culture. Becoming aware of this can help us see how to improve
              trust with the people we work with.

              When Valeria first met her international clients, she tried to
              bond with them by telling them about her family and her parenting

              On the first day of a course, trainer David aimed to reassure his

              enthusiastically about the big corporations he had previously
              worked in and the famous clients he had trained. He mentioned the
              good feedback he'd received and showed the results he was able to

              There are many ways of building trust, and the approach we choose
              might depend on the relationship we are building, the culture we
              are used to and our personal preferences. However, if the methods
              we choose do not match the expectations of the people around us,
              it can lead to misunderstandings and negative assessments.
            </p>
            <p class="section_second_content section_wrap_content">
              Let's consider different approaches to building trust. Author and
              speaker Richard Barrett suggests that there are two main
              components of trust: character and competence. One way of building
              trust is to show that we are caring, fair, open and honest human
              beings. In other words, we can build trust by showing our
              character. Another way to build trust is by letting others know
              that we are capable, experienced and have achieved excellent
              results. This way of building trust emphasises our competence.
            </p>
            <p class="section_second_content section_wrap_content">
              It can be a useful exercise to analyse specific work relationships
              in terms of the character/competence model. You might think about
              the type of trust your relationship has and the type of trust your
              relationship lacks, in order to see how you can develop. Many of
              us use both approaches, depending on the context. For example, in
              a job interview, we might focus on establishing trust by
              demonstrating our competence through work experience. When we are
              working within a team, we might prioritise showing our character
              to form close professional relationships. By becoming aware of the
              context and how our conversation partners are responding to our
              trust-building efforts, we can adapt the way we build trust to
              better suit them.

              It might be tempting to think you can do everything faster and
              better than your team members. It might be hard to hand over tasks
              you enjoy doing. But attempting to do everything all by yourself
              shows poor leadership and can end in personal burnout. You end up
              overworked, stressed and unable to be the leader your team needs.

            <p class="section_third_content section_wrap_content">
              Leading a team brings new responsibilities and challenges, and
              managers need to learn to delegate as much as possible. That means
              sharing or transferring some of your responsibilities, and
              trusting other people to do some of the work that you normally do.
              Effective delegation gives you the time and space to offer the
              support needed, deal with the problems that arise and keep an eye
              on the bigger picture – things that a leader should be doing.

              As you consider what tasks to delegate, here are three tips on how
              you can delegate effectively.

              <li class="list_item">
                <span class="list_span">Start with smaller tasks</span>
                If you're worried about handing over large projects, start by
                delegating the smaller tasks that don't require much overseeing.
                This will also give your team members time to get used to their
                new responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li class="list_item">
                <span class="list_span"
                  >Delegate tasks that will develop your team members</span
                >Delegation shouldn't just be about reducing your workload. It
                should also be about developing your team and giving them
                learning opportunities. Choose tasks that help their
                professional development, and allow them time to get better at
                doing them. By passing on work you are good at doing yourself
                and training your team members to do it, you're helping them
                grow professionally.

                  >Delegate tasks to people who might like them
                </span>
                A good team leader knows their team well and knows which tasks
                would suit which person best. Don't just delegate tasks you
                don't like doing. When people are doing tasks they enjoy,
                they're more motivated to do the best job they can do.
